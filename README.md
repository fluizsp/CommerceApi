Commerce API Project
About The Project
Welcome to the Commerce API project! This project is a .NET Core Web API designed to simulate a simple commerce system, featuring a range of functionalities from product listings to customer management.

The Commerce API is structured around key entities such as products, customers, orders, and order details, providing a solid foundation for a commerce-related application. Whether you're interested in how .NET Core APIs are built or looking for inspiration for your projects, I hope you find this project both informative and engaging.

Built With
.NET Core: For creating high-performance, cross-platform web APIs.
Entity Framework Core: For data access.
Swagger: For API documentation and testing.
SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition: As the database back-end.
