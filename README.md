# Commerce API Project
## About The Project
Welcome to the Commerce API project! This project is a .NET Core Web API designed to simulate a simple commerce system, featuring a range of functionalities from product listings to customer management.

The Commerce API is structured around key entities such as products, customers, orders, and order details, providing a solid foundation for a commerce-related application. Whether you're interested in how .NET Core APIs are built or looking for inspiration for your projects, I hope you find this project both informative and engaging.

- **[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)**: For data access.
- **[Swagger](https://swagger.io/)**: For API documentation and testing.
- **[SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)**: As the database back-end.
